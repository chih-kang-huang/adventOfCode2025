A collection of my solutions to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) challenges.

Remarks: 

* Day 10 second part: In order to solve the problem efficiently, i decided to use `scipy.optimize.milp`.
* Day 12 : A heuristic check to see if it is possible to fill the region with 3x3 boxes under the number of presents, it turns out this is sufficient for deduce the answer for the given input.
